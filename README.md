# IR Infrared Obstacke Avoidance Sensor Monitoring and Led Control with ESP32 & MQTT

## üì° Description

This project allows you to control a led and detect objects using an IR sensor via MQTT over WiFi using an ESP32. It leverages the `WiFi.h` and `PubSubClient.h` libraries for network and MQTT communication. The system publishes sensor data and listens for control commands to manage the led, making it suitable demo for IoT-based object detection and remote control applications.

## üõ† Hardware Setup

### Components:
- ESP32 microcontroller
- IR sensor
- LED
- Breadboard and jumper wires

### Circuit:
1. **IR Sensor**:
   - OUT ‚Üí GPIO 4 on ESP32
   - VCC ‚Üí 3.3V on ESP32
   - GND ‚Üí GND

2. **LED**:
   - Anode (long leg) ‚Üí GPIO 15 through a resistor
   - Cathode (short leg) ‚Üí GND

## üîå Functionality Overview

1. **WiFi Connection**  
   The ESP32 connects to a WiFi network to establish a WSN (Wireless Sensor Network) for communication.

2. **Serial Debugging**  
   Serial Monitor shows WiFi status, IP address, and MQTT events for debugging.

3. **MQTT Broker Connection**  
   The device connects to a public MQTT broker (`broker.emqx.io`) and subscribes to `/aliaa/led` topic for LED control.

4. **Object Detection with IR**  
   - Publishes `OBJECT_DETECTED` to `/aliaa/ir` topic if IR sensor detects something.
   - Publishes `NO_OBJECT_DETECTED` otherwise.

5. **LED Control**  
   - Subscribes to messages on `/aliaa/led` so you can you control the led based on what the esp received:
     - `LED_ON` ‚Üí Turns LED on
     - `LED_OFF` ‚Üí Turns LED off

6. **IoT MQTT Panel App**  
   - Add a **switch** that sends/publishes `LED_ON` when turned on or `LED_OFF` when turned off to `/aliaa/led`.
   - Add a **LED widget** that listens/subscribes to `/aliaa/ir` and lights up if `OBJECT_DETECTED` is received and turnes back off if `NO_OBJECT_DETECTED` is received from the esp over mqtt.

## üìö Libraries Required

- WiFi.h
- PubSubClient.h

Install via the Arduino Library Manager.

## üöÄ How to Run

1. Connect your hardware as described.
2. Upload the code using the Arduino IDE.
3. Open Serial Monitor at 9600 baud rate.
4. Use IoT MQTT Panel or any MQTT app to interact.

## üîê Notes

- The broker used is public, so messages are not secure. For production, use secure connections and authentication. You can use a private broker and mqtts for more security.
- Modify `ssid` and `pass` in the code for your WiFi credentials.
- When running the code, the connection was getting stuck at connecting to WiFi..., and WiFi.status() was returning the value 6.
After some research, adding `WiFi.mode(WIFI_STA)`; in the setup() function resolved the issue by forcing the ESP to use Station mode.
You may not need this line if your WiFi connection works without it. More information on WiFi status codes can be found here: https://forum.arduino.cc/t/serial-println-wifi-status-codes-meaning/486265
- If your ESP device is unable to connect to your network, check your router for firewall rules or MAC address filtering that may be blocking the connection.
- This code is compatible with `ESP8266` boards like the NodeMCU. However, you must replace `#include <WiFi.h>` with `#include <ESP8266WiFi.h>`.
